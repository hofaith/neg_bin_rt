# Description
Codes to implement analysis on accounting for the potential of overdispersion in estimation of the time-varying reproduction number
# Details
Running truedata_rt.R generates the reproduction number (Rt) by Poisson and negative binomial likelihood. p80.R generates the proportion of cases attributed to the transmission of 80% of total cases according to the Rt generated from truedata_rt.R. simulation_rt.R generates the simulated Rt when k = 2 (or other values by changing lines 18 and 19). Figure1.R, Figure2.R, Figure3.R and Figure4.R are codes for regenerating figures.
